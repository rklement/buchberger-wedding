				<p>Kory and Elisha’s story did not start until they were in high school.  Although both grew up in the Wisconsin Rapids area, they attended different junior high schools. Elisha being a rough-nosed, trouble-making “Westie,” and Kory being the straight-laced “Eastie.” It was not until the “Westies” and the “Easties” were forced to share a high school together that Kory and Elisha were truly acquainted, sophomore year.</p>

				<p>Over the next couple of years, Kory and Elisha shared a lot of the same classes and started to hang out with same group of people. It was not until the summer before senior year that the opportunity came around when both of them were single. When Kory saw that opportunity, he struck like a fierce anaconda and asked Elisha if she would be his girlfriend. She happily said “yes.”</p>

				<p>Both Kory and Elisha went to college at the University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point. They were able to stay together the entire four years while attending.</p>

				<p>After graduation, Kory accepted a position as an intern at a medical center in Hays, Kansas. While Kory was in Kansas, Elisha was still in Stevens Point when she received the news that she was accepted into the four year pharmacy program at Chicago State University. </p>

				<p>After Kory completed his internship in Kansas, he eventually accepted a position in Roscoe, IL that was about two hours away from where Elisha was staying in Chicago. Although they were somewhat close to each other, they were usually only able to see each other about every four to five weeks. Even though it was not easy, they managed to keep their relationship alive.</p>

				<p>Going into Elisha’s senior year at Chicago State, Kory got a new job and relocated to Wausau, Wisconsin. Being about five hours away from each other, seeing one another was extremely hard. They would go months without seeing each other until Elisha was on winter vacation from school and was able to spend that time in Wausau with Kory. </p>

			 	<p>Fast forward to February 2014 - Elisha made a trip to Wausau to visit Kory, and it was then when Kory finally asked Elisha to marry him. Much like she did in high school, Elisha happily said “yes.”</p>

				<p>Elisha graduated from pharmacy school in May of 2014 and moved to Wausau where she was accepted into a one year residency program at the Aspirus hospital. 
				Upon completion of her residency program, Elisha accepted a position in Fond Du Lac, WI, where she and Kory currently reside.</p>

				<p>After 10 years of being together, Kory and Elisha are finally tying the knot in October of 2015. They are both extremely excited for their special day to come, and to be able to spend it with their great friends and family.</p>
